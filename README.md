# InvestmentCalc

This program was to calculate compound interest based on user input

I thought the use of the user defined class was implemented well.  The class was simple, but effective, with a constructor that calculated most values.

An area where the program could have been improved was how the main file had too many functions in it. This could have been broken up a bit better or associated with the class in a more thoughtful manner.

Shared pointer vector was the most challenging to write as I was not familiar with it.  But once I was able to replace the correct pieces, the program worked exactly how it worked before.

The use of classes and vectors seems to be extremely good way of handling data.  To be able to manipulate the information that easily has to be beneficial.

The program will hopefully be easily maintainable by adding simple functions to perform some of the work rather than being part of the main function.  Comments were included to describe what they do.  To make it more readable, some of the calculations should be moved to the class itself.
